The Repository Service for TUF has two main services (``rstuf-rest-api``,
``rstuf-repo-worker``) and one tool (``rstuf-cli``)

.. uml:: ../../diagrams/2_2_rstuf.puml

By design, it helps scalability and reliability for complex and
distributed deployment. As the example below


.. uml:: ../../diagrams/2_3_rstuf.puml
